# Grafcet_to_Automaton
Grafcet model can be translated into an equivalent formal model, a FSM with inputs and outputs, which can be used for verification purposes or to build conformance test sequences. The knowledge of the SLA (Stable Location Automaton) permits for instance to check absence of deadlock, reachability of particular locations, possibility of firing sequences or absence of conflicting outputs at every moment.
